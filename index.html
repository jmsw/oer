    <h2>Open Educational Resources<br></h2>
    <p>Open educational resources are learning materials that are made available for others to freely adapt and remix in their own teaching and learning. The materials presented here involve the first secular women's magazine in Britain, the <i>Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine</i>, which was published between 1852-1879, in London, especially during the period when it was run by editors Samuel O. Beeton and Isabella Mary Mayson Beeton, between 1852 and 1865. </a> </p>

    <h3>OER 1: "Female Education" Essay, 1852<br></h3>

      It includes a slideshow in Google Slides, as well as readings for students that include the text of the essay in its original magazine-page form and as plain text. <BR><br>

  <h3>OER 2: Consecutive Issues Assignment</h3>
  <p>This is a project assignment based on students reading consecutive issues of a historic magazine.<br> 
    It makes use of the open-access index to the <i>Englishwoman's Domestic Magazine</i> developed for my dissertation project, but could be used with other publications instead. <br> 
    This assignment can be adapted to work as either a group or individual project. It is available as a PDF and DOCX file below.<br><br>
